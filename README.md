# Spring Cloud Contract

You always need confidence when pushing new features into a new application or service in a distributed system. To that end, this project provides support for consumer-driven contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, and asserting that a contract is kept by producers and consumers — for both HTTP and message-based interactions.
